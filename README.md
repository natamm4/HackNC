# HackNC - Heels & Meals

At UNC, our development team noticed a growing issue among students: too much food going to waste, and too many students missing out on affordable, fresh meals.

This summer, our team first encountered an app called *Too Good To Go* while studying abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark. This application allows people in big cities to purchase food for cheaper.

Inspired, we came together to build something tailored for our community: an application that connects UNC students with local restaurants and stores to find discounted meals from surplus food that would otherwise go to waste.

As a part of our project, we created an ios app and a website platform.
