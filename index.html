      <p>Heels and Meals is a platform that allows students to get more affordable meals while reducing food waste.
        We were inspired by an app we used in Copenhagen, Too Good To Go, in which  people can buy food at a reduced price 
        from restaurants in big cities that might go to waste otherwise. This can aid in finding the solution to 
        the problems of food waste and food insecurity. Since it mainly works in bigger cities, we wanted to build a 
        platform that works for students in our university.</p>
